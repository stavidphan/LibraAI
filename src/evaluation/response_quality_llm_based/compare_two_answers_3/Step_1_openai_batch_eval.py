        You are an expert tasked with evaluating two answers to the same question based on three criteria: **Comprehensiveness**, **Diversity**, and **Empowerment**.
        """

        prompt = f"""
        You will evaluate two answers to the same question based on three criteria: **Comprehensiveness**, **Diversity**, and **Empowerment**.

        - **Comprehensiveness**: How much detail does the answer provide to cover all aspects and details of the question?
        - **Diversity**: How varied and rich is the answer in providing different perspectives and insights on the question?
        - **Empowerment**: How well does the answer help the reader understand and make informed judgments about the topic?

        For each criterion, select the better answer: "Answer 1", "Answer 2", or "Equal".  
        **"Equal"** means that both answers provide equally good information for that criterion â€” neither is clearly better. For example, if the question asks for the price of a product, and both answers provide the correct price with similar clarity, then select "Equal".

        Provide a concise explanation (1-2 sentences) for your choice in each criterion.

        Then, select an **Overall Winner**: "Answer 1", "Answer 2", or "Equal", and summarize why you selected it based on the three criteria.

        Here is the question:
        {query}

        Here are the two answers:

        **Answer 1:**
        {answer1}

        **Answer 2:**
        {answer2}

        Output your evaluation as a valid JSON object with the following structure:

        {{
            "Comprehensiveness": {{
                "Winner": "Answer 1" or "Answer 2" or "Equal",
                "Explanation": "Explain why this answer is better (or equal) for comprehensiveness."
            }},
            "Diversity": {{
                "Winner": "Answer 1" or "Answer 2" or "Equal",
                "Explanation": "Explain why this answer is better (or equal) for diversity."
            }},
            "Empowerment": {{
                "Winner": "Answer 1" or "Answer 2" or "Equal",
                "Explanation": "Explain why this answer is better (or equal) for empowerment."
            }},
            "Overall Winner": {{
                "Winner": "Answer 1" or "Answer 2" or "Equal",
                "Explanation": "Summarize why this answer is the overall winner (or equal) based on the three criteria."
            }}
        }}

        **Important Instructions**:
        - The output must be a **valid JSON object** with all braces (`{{` and `}}`) properly closed.
        - Do not include markdown (```json```), extra newlines, spaces, or any text outside the JSON object.
        - Ensure "Winner" is exactly one of: "Answer 1", "Answer 2", or "Equal".
        - Keep explanations concise (2-3 sentences) to avoid exceeding token limits.
        - If the token limit is reached, prioritize completing the JSON structure (especially closing all braces) over adding more explanation.
        - Double-check that the JSON includes all four keys: "Comprehensiveness", "Diversity", "Empowerment", and "Overall Winner".
